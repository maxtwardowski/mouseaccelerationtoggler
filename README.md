# mouseaccelerationtoggler
A short script enabling/disabling mouse acceleration (Enhance pointer precision feature) on Windows OS using Python pywinauto module. Use the .bat file to run it (both files have to be in the same directory). The script assumes that you've already added Python3 to your PATH and installed the pywinauto module (https://pywinauto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation).
